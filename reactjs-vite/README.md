# ReactJS + Vite + TailwindCSS

This template provides you a head start on your new [ReactJS](https://react.dev/learn) +
[Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) projects. It defines a
structure for:

- Folder organization
- Component implementation
- Service separation
- Best project practices

## Starting with the template

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The project will be accessible on `http://localhost:3000`. Use your browser to access it.
From here, you can start building!

## Running tests

The template uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/) for running tests. To run all the tests, execute:

```bash
npm run test
```

To watch the tests (i.e. re-run tests after a modification), execute:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```
